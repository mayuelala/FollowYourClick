Python COUNTLESS Downsampling
=============================

To install:  

`pip install -r requirements.txt`  

To test:

`python test.py`  

To benchmark countless2d:

`python python/countless2d.py python/images/gray_segmentation.png`

To benchmark countless3d:

`python python/countless3d.py`

Adjust N and the list of algorithms inside each script to modify the run parameters.


Python3 is slightly faster than Python2.
